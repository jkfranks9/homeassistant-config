#     Lighting Card     #
#=======================#

# NOTES:
#
# 1) Normal light groups (light.xxx) have the light symbols passed as a simple list ('letters' variable).
# 2) Old style light groups (group.xxx) are used for groups that include Christmas lights. They have
#    the symbols passed from a template sensor, as part of the dynamic group logic.
# 3) Groups that include fans cannot just contain the fan light, because they operate in optimistic mode
#    and can't just be turned on or off, because we don't know the current state. So they are instead
#    specified directly here (using the 'items' variable), along with all the other lights in the group.
#    Not a fan (haha) but what can I do?
# 4) The family room group also includes a fan light, but is an old style group, which is dynamically
#    modified according to Christmas mode. So the dynamic group logic also must include the fan light.
