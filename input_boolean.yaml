# We don't know about the Amazon plug itself (it's proprietary). So this input boolean is used as an analog.
# Automations detect when this is turned on/off, and use the Alexa Media Player integration to send voice  
# commands to Alexa that trigger routines to operate the actual plug.
#
# A template switch is also defined that is based on this input boolean, which is then changed via switch-as-x
# to a light, which then allows the plug to be placed in a light group. Thus the input boolean, switch and light
# all reflect the same state, and any of those entities can be used to control the plug.
