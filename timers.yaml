#     Timers     #
#================#

# NOTES: 
#   - All timers must be added to the save_timers automation in homeassistant.yaml.
#
#   - We should allow for the extremely unlikely scenario that all timers could be active simultaneously.
#     Timers are saved and restored over a restart by using a pair of input texts for active and paused
#     timers, and input texts are limited to 255 characters. So keep the timer names short and unusable!
#     With 3 character timer names there is room for 17 timers:
#
#       ((num timers * (12 + length of name)) - 1)
#
#     Since all timers active at once is ridiculous, we've exceeded the maximum.
