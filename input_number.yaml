# HEAVY SIGH. I created these to have one place to update if I want to change these values. However, they are used
# in templates with the float filter, which now requires a default value, as in float(0). Since these are indeed
# constants, the float values have been changed with the proper default, as in float(3). Which means I still have
# to update them everywhere if they ever change. Waaaaaa!
