#     Zigbee Initialization     #
#===============================#

# So this is cheating, and might not always work. I have a catch-22 during HA startup:
#
# 1) As zigbee devices are initialized by Zigbee2MQTT they change from 'unavailable' state
# 2) In parallel, the Current Zigbee Unavailable Devices sensor gets initialized
# 3) As a result, some zigbee devices might still be unavailable when the sensor is ready, resulting in a bogus numerical state for the sensor
# 4) As the rest of the zigbee devices come up, the state of the above sensor continues to change toward 0
# 5) About the same time, the Notify Zigbee Device Unavailable automation gets initialized and starts running, triggered by one of the above sensor changes
# 
# At this point, the automation will likely fail due to templates not resolving correctly, but even if there are no failures, the automation should not
# be running at all at this point, since it's just churn during startup. OK, I guess it's possible that a zigbee device could choose to really go unavailable
# at the same time, but oh well. I care less about that than seeing a bunch of errors in the log.
#
# So, the below automation runs at startup and sets a flag, which prevents Notify Zigbee Device Unavailable from running. It waits a bit, then resets the
# flag, so the automation can run for real if a zigbee device becomes unavailable.
#
# So what was that about cheating? Automations are initialized in the order they are read from the files in the automations directory. This file is 'devices',
# which is alphabetically before 'notification'. Which gives me a VERY short amount of time to get this flag set before the notification automation runs.
# So yeah, super awesome stuff.

#     House Open/Close Timing     #
#=================================#

# Deal with the open/close house timing issue. The problem is:
# 
# - One tracker changes to home or not_home state, which changes the person to home or not_home, driving Open House or Close House
# - A second tracker gets an attribute updated (but NOT the state), which changes the person back to not_home or home, driving Close House or Open House
# - The second tracker then changes to home or not_home state, which again drives Open House or Close House
#
# Note that nothing too terrible actually happens: I have seen the garage door get stuck partially open, and a notification that it can't be closed,
# both due to the garage door opener being triggered twice within 1 second. I can live with that, but stuff like this drives me bonkers.
