# Catch an error resulting from a GetMusicVideos Kodi call. I'm assuming this is a timing issue, but hate guessing
# at delay times as a solution. So if we get a selected error set a toggle (the toggle is always reset before issuing
# the GetMusicVideos call to Kodi). The toggle is checked in the Get All Kodi Videos script, which then results in a
# retry of the Kodi call. Fingers crossed.
