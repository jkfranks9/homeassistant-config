# Update the Last Alexa sensor, which contains the most recently spoken to echo device.
# NOTES:
# 1) Amazon (or maybe Alexa Media Player) does seem to update the last called attribute of echo devices automatically, but the delay
#    can be rather long.
# 2) For scripts called via voice where we need to know the device spoken to, the Update Last Alexa Device script is run, which forces
#    the last called to be updated immediately.
# 3) In either case, this automation should ensure that the Last Alexa sensor always contains the media player with valid last called
#    data, including the last called timestamp.
