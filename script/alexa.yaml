#     Alexa Actionable Notification     #
#=======================================#

# This integrates with the Alexa custom skill AlexaActionableNotification. This skill allows us to have Alexa ask questions
# and then process the response. There are 3 parts to this process:
#
# 1) An automation or script is used to call this script with the message to be announced and the echo device to use.
#    More importantly, the event ID is provided, which is used in step 3.
# 2) This script invokes the skill with the event ID. Alexa then asks a question and waits for a response. The skill then
#    fires the alexa_actionable_notification event with the supplied event ID.
# 3) An automation listens for the event and event ID and takes whatever action is desired.

# The second script (called from the Handle Fan Room Response automation) then asks for the fan setting,
