#     Cinema Activation     #
#===========================#

# There are several ways to use the cinema:
#
# 1) Open for general usage
# 2) Play a feature movie
# 3) Play a random set of music videos
# 4) Start a specific Harmony activity
# 5) Watch a specific Shield TV app
#
# It is possible to use these in various combinations; a few examples:
#
# - open, watch an app, watch another app, ...
# - open, play a feature movie
# - open, start an activity, watch an app, watch videos
#
# So we need a generic script that is a front end to all of these. It needs to do the following:
#
# - Enforce cinema usage control, to prevent rapid open/close activity.
# - Turn on the desired Harmony activity, which ensures the correct devices are turned on.
# - Wait for the projector to warm up if needed.
# - Activate the Kodi app if needed.
# - Perform post-open tasks if needed.
