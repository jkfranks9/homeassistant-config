#     Non Bedroom Lights Out     #
#================================#

# Turn off all lights except guest suites and related night lights.
# Note that the theater and most upstairs common lights are not included here, in case the upstairs
# bedroom is occupied. In that case, such lights might still be in use at my bedtime. The 
# Establish Bedtime Environment script takes care of any additional lights that need to be off, based 
# on occupied bedrooms.
